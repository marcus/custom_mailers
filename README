CustomMailers
===========

Use ActionMailer to send email from a SMTP server settings specified at runtime.

Example
=======

MyMailer.deliver_from({:address => "localhost", :port => 25, :domain => "mail.mydomain.com"}) do  |mailer|
  mailer.deliver_test_email                                                                                    
end

Credits
=======

This code is largely inspired by nakajima's many-mailers:

The functionality is different enough that it seemed like it deserved a separate project. ManyMailers requires you to specify the SMTP servers you'll use in a YAML file that gets loaded when your application starts, CustomMailers allows you to specify it at runtime (from settings stored in the database, for example).
